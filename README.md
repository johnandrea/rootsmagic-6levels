# rootsmagic-6levels
Insert 6levels facts into a RootsMagic database.

"6 levels" is a genealogy research concept from Yvette Hoitink:
https://www.dutchgenealogy.nl/six-levels-ancestral-profiles/
The 6 level values should be stored in the database as a custom fact; value 0 to 6.

This code does not make use of level 0 (unknown name) due to no easy/consistant way to
describe someone with no name. And this code can't set any levels above 4 because those
are subjective.

## Installation

Requires the SQLite command line interface and these .sql files.

The SQLite command line program is available in the appropriate "tools" download at: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

## Options

None

## Usage
